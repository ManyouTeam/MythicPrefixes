## ‚ö†Ô∏è Design Philosophy & Important Notes

Unlike other ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù tag plugins, **MythicPrefixes** is **not** made for beginners.

- ‚ùå **No built-in tag shop** ‚Äî  
  You can easily implement one using your favorite **shop** or **menu plugin**.

- ‚ùå **No tag storage or inventory** ‚Äî  
  The plugin does **not store any player tag data**.  
  Instead, it uses **permission nodes** and **conditions** to determine which tags a player can use.  
  This design requires basic knowledge of **permission plugins**.

- ‚ùå **No tag cards** ‚Äî  
  You can achieve similar effects using **custom item plugins**.

> MythicPrefixes is designed for experienced server owners who value flexibility and control.
